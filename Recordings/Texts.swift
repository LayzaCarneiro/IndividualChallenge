    While he was picking out his favorite vegetables, Conrad started to hear the loudest screaming. He wondered what happened. He walked over to the ice cream aisle and found what was causing the noise.

    "Day at the Beach": """
    Lexie jumped into the wave and was immediately immersed in the water. She stood up and came out of the water. "I love the water, I love the waves and I love the sand," she said.

    When she got home from school Gracie wanted her favorite treat, chocolate chip cookies. She mixed all of the ingredients together, put the cookie dough on the sheet and put the sheet in the oven.

    After they were finished baking she pulled them out of the oven. Even though they were still hot she put a whole cookie right in her mouth. She quickly spit it out because it tasted really salty. "I guess I read the recipe wrong," she said.

    "All On Account of Rain": """
    Katie had been waiting for 5 months to see the movie, and now she was late. The rain was pouring so hard that her mother had to drive slower than usual.

    "Scared Stiff": """
    Zander was proud of his new costume. He was excited to wear it for the play on Friday night. The bones looked like a real skeleton, the eyes were beady and red, and the claws were long and sharp.

    He thought it would be fun to scare his Mom, so he walked quietly down the hall toward the kitchen. Suddenly, he screamed "Ahhhhhhh!" He saw his reflection in the mirror and forgot he was wearing his costume.

    "Woohoo!" they exclaimed after the car had come to a stop, "we should definitely do that again!"

    "To be, or not to be, that is the question - Hamlet": """
    To be, or not to be, that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
    And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause—there's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.

    "The Fox and The Crow": """
    There once was a big black crow sitting high up in the trees. In his beak he had a nice, round cheese.

    Along came a fox, as clever as they come, "Mmmm," he thought. "I'd like to have a bite of that cheese. It will be easy to get some...."

    "Oh crow," called fox, "if your voice is half as beautiful as those fine feathers I see, it would please my ears to hear you sing a little melody!"

    Well, crow had never heard anyone say such a complimentary thing. So, he opened up his beak and he began to squawk and sing.

    Down fell the cheese into the waiting mouth of the fox below.

    "Oh no!" squawked the crow, "you've stolen my dinner!"

    "Not at all!" said the fox, licking his lips. "It was a fair enough trade! Vain crow, with your head up in the trees! You got the compliments, and I got the cheese!"

    "The Boy Who Cried Wolf": """
    There once was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. To amuse himself he took a great breath and sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The Wolf is chasing the sheep!"

    The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.

    "Don't cry 'wolf', shepherd boy," said the villagers, "when there's no wolf!" They went grumbling back down the hill.

    Later, the boy sang out again, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the hill to help him drive the wolf away.

    When the villagers saw no wolf they sternly said, "Save your frightened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is NO wolf!"

    But the boy just grinned and watched them go grumbling down the hill once more.

    Later, he saw a REAL wolf prowling about his flock. Alarmed, he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, "Wolf! Wolf!"

    But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come.

    At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping.

    "There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, "Wolf!" Why didn't you come?"

    An old man tried to comfort the boy as they walked back to the village.

    "We'll help you look for the lost sheep in the morning," he said, putting his arm around the youth, "Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!"

    "All in the golden afternoon - by Lewis Carroll": """
    All in the golden afternoon
    Full leisurely we glide;
    For both our oars, with little skill,
    By little arms are plied,
    While little hands make vain pretence
    Our wanderings to guide.

    Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
    Beneath such dreamy weather,
    To beg a tale of breath too weak
    To stir the tiniest feather!
    Yet what can one poor voice avail
    Against three tongues together?

    Imperious Prima flashes forth
    Her edict ‘to begin it’ –
    In gentler tone Secunda hopes
    ‘There will be nonsense in it!’ –
    While Tertia interrupts the tale
    Not more than once a minute.

    Anon, to sudden silence won,
    In fancy they pursue
    The dream-child moving through a land
    Of wonders wild and new,
    In friendly chat with bird or beast –
    And half believe it true.

    And ever, as the story drained
    The wells of fancy dry,
    And faintly strove that weary one
    To put the subject by,
    “The rest next time -” “It is next time!”
    The happy voices cry.

    Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
    Thus slowly, one by one,
    Its quaint events were hammered out –
    And now the tale is done,
    And home we steer, a merry crew,
    Beneath the setting sun.

    Alice! a childish story take,
    And with a gentle hand
    Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined
    In Memory’s mystic band,
    Like pilgrim’s wither’d wreath of flowers
    Pluck’d in a far-off land.

    "Zig-Zag Walk": """
    Under the waves at the bottom of the sea, a mother crab scolded her daughter.

    "Why are you scurrying side to side in that ridiculous zig-zag walk of yours? Come forward! Walk straight, like other creatures do!"

    "But mother," squeaked the little crab, "I learned to walk from you! If you want something different of me...change the example I see!"

    And with that, the little crab zig-zig-zig zagged away.

    "Sour Grapes": """
    A hungry fox noticed a juicy bunch of grapes growing high on a grapevine. He leaped. He snapped. Drooling, he jumped to reach them, but try as he might, he could not obtain the tasty prize.

    Disappointed by the fruitless efforts he'd made to get the grapes that day, he said, with a shrug, to comfort himself, "Oh, they were probably sour anyway!"

    "Running For His Life": """
    One day a hound dog went hunting by himself in the woods. He spotted a rabbit in the underbrush and chased him out into the open. The rabbit darted this way and that. The dog followed. The rabbit ran, with the dog at his heels, around trees and through an open field.

    When the dog began to tire of the chase, the rabbit, with one last burst of energy, dashed into the thicket and escaped to safety.

    As the dog turned back for home, a goat herder who had seen the chase jeered at him, saying, "Some hunter you are! You let that rabbit get the best of you!"

    "You forget," replied the tired dog, "about the rabbit's strife! I was only running for my supper. He was running for his life!"
